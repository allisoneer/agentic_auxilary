## Common Commands

### thoughts_tool
```bash
cd thoughts_tool && make all       # Check, test, and build (silent)
cd thoughts_tool && make check     # Run formatting and clippy checks
cd thoughts_tool && make test      # Run tests
cd thoughts_tool && make build     # Build the project
```

### universal_tool
```bash
cd universal_tool && make all       # Check, test, and build (silent)
cd universal_tool && make check     # Run formatting and clippy checks
cd universal_tool && make test      # Run tests
cd universal_tool && make build     # Build the project

# Or using cargo directly
cd universal_tool && cargo build --workspace --all-features
```

### claudecode_rs
```bash
cd claudecode_rs && make all       # Check, test, and build (silent)
cd claudecode_rs && make check     # Run formatting and clippy checks
cd claudecode_rs && make test      # Run tests
cd claudecode_rs && make build     # Build the project
```

### pr_comments
```bash
cd pr_comments && make all       # Check, test, and build (silent)
cd pr_comments && make check     # Run formatting and clippy checks
cd pr_comments && make test      # Run tests
cd pr_comments && make build     # Build the project
```

### gpt5_reasoner
```bash
cd gpt5_reasoner && make all       # Check, test, and build (silent)
cd gpt5_reasoner && make check     # Run formatting and clippy checks
cd gpt5_reasoner && make test      # Run tests
cd gpt5_reasoner && make build     # Build the project

# Useful during debugging:
RUST_LOG=gpt5_reasoner=debug make test
```

All tools support verbose and normal output variants for their make commands (e.g., `make test-normal`, `make test-verbose`).

## README version sync (xtask)

- Run locally to update README versions:
```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- readme-sync
```
- Dry run (prints updated README content to stdout, does not write file):
```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- readme-sync --dry-run
```
- Strict mode (fail on malformed markers or unknown crates):
```bash
AUTODEPS_STRICT=1 cargo run -p xtask -- readme-sync
```

## Code Style Guidelines

Rules on comment annotations:

- Keep TODO annotations tagged with severity/priority:
    - TODO(0): Egregious bugs, marked temporarily during development, should never be merged to head
    - TODO(1): Significant architectural flaws, minor bugs
    - TODO(2): Minor design flaws, lacking elegance, missing functionality
    - TODO(3): Minor issues, e.g., lacking unit test coverage
